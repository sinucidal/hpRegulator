5V 2.5A switch-mode voltage regulator based off Micrel chipset

Using an MIC2178-5.0BWM chip from Micrel this circuit should be able to supply up to 2.5 at 5V to feed even the hungriest project.
I developed it for use on a mobile battery pack for a Raspberry Pi rev. 3.0 project that was drawing just under 2A. Right now this 
post will have just the rev. 1.0 information but once I get the board and components I will thoroughly test the system and make
updates to this post accordingly. This file will be the progress log. It should be noted the schematic is based off their data-sheet for the device (http://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/74541/MICREL/MIC2178-5.0BWM.html), I just gave a component layout and trace routing. I used KiCad 4.0.5 for the project.
